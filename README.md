We generated a model of Mario tennis using a reinforcement learning algorithm called DQN.
Mario runs on a reinforcement learning model, eventually grew to win Luigi.

## Requirements
Tested PC spec is as below.

OS:Windows10, CPU:core i5-2400, GPU:GTX-1060, Memory:16GB

## Initial setting

1. The dolphin emulator. You can download from [here](https://ja.dolphin-emu.org/download/). Stable version is better.
2. The Mario Power Tennis iso image.
3. Python 3. On Windows, you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Train


1. Launch MarioTennis on dolphin emulator.
2. Set windows looks lile the image.

3. Run the proggram.

```bash
cd ./src
python Tennis_AI_normal
```

## Evaluation

You can see that as the number of games increases, the rewards for serving games also increase.
However, in return games, the rewards are decreasing rather than increasing.

The breakdown of points is as above.
