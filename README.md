Generated MarioTennnis model based on Reinforcement learning.

## Requirements
Tested on: Windows10
1. The dolphin emulator. You can download from [here](https://ja.dolphin-emu.org/download/). Stable version is better.
2. The Mario Power Tennis iso image.
3. Python 3. On Windows, you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Train
```bash
cd ./src/ 
python Tennis_AI
```

## Evaluation

You can see that as the number of games increases, the rewards for serving games also increase.
However, in return games, the rewards are decreasing rather than increasing.

## Play
Inference mode hasn't implemented, yet.
